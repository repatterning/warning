The heaviest rain will be over hills and mountains although with pulses of heavier rain extending more widely at times, during Thursday in particular. \n\nFrom late Wednesday through to early Friday, 50-75 mm of rain is expected to build up widely with 100-150 mm over west facing mountains. From Tuesday through to early Friday, as much as 200-250 mm of rain is likely to build up over a few mountains. \n\nLater on Thursday and during Thursday night, rain will likely be accompanied by a spell of strong winds before rain eases across these areas for a time. However, there is the potential for another spell of wet and windy weather to soon follow on Friday.\n\n\nWhat Should I Do?\n\nCheck if your property could be at risk of flooding. If so, consider preparing a flood plan and an emergency flood kit. \n\nGive yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary. \n\nPeople cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. Itâ€™s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items. \n\nBe prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.", "modifiedDate": "2025-09-29T09:36:23Z", "validFromDate": "2025-10-01T16:00:00Z", "affectedAreas": [ { "regionName": "Central, Tayside & Fife", "regionCode": "TA", "subRegions": [ "Perth and Kinross", "Stirling" ] }, { "regionName": "Highlands & Eilean Siar", "regionCode": "HE", "subRegions": [ "Highland" ] }, { "regionName": "Strathclyde", "regionCode": "ST", "subRegions": [ "Argyll and Bute", "Inverclyde", "North Ayrshire", "Renfrewshire", "West Dunbartonshire" ] } ], "warningImpact": 3, "validToDate": "2025-10-03T05:00:00Z" }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [ -6.2952, 57.5217 ], [ -6.8637, 57.3961 ], [ -7.0972, 56.9689 ], [ -7.1301, 56.6623 ], [ -7.1082, 56.2495 ], [ -7.0203, 56.0107 ], [ -6.828, 55.8229 ], [ -6.5259, 55.5892 ], [ -6.1963, 55.3841 ], [ -5.8755, 55.2616 ], [ -5.5745, 55.2666 ], [ -5.3877, 55.3016 ], [ -5.2207, 55.3054 ], [ -5.0537, 55.3679 ], [ -4.8933, 55.449 ], [ -4.7637, 55.5348 ], [ -4.6736, 55.6813 ], [ -4.5637, 55.8519 ], [ -4.4275, 55.9861 ], [ -4.2759, 56.0585 ], [ -4.1792, 56.148 ], [ -4.2627, 56.5231 ], [ -4.6956, 57.2029 ], [ -5.1702, 57.4225 ], [ -5.8008, 57.5483 ], [ -6.2952, 57.5217 ] ] ] ] } }
