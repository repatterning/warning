Gusts of around 50-60 mph are likely around coasts and hills, with 70-80 mph possible in the most exposed locations, with the windiest conditions expected on Monday morning and moving eastwards as the day progresses.\n\nWhat Should I Do?\n\nPrepare to protect your property and people from injury. Check for loose items outside your home and plan how you could secure them. Items include; bins, garden furniture, trampolines, tents, sheds, and fences.  \n\nGive yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary. \n \nPeople cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. Itâ€™s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items.  \n\nIf you are on the coast, stay safe during stormy weather by being aware of large waves. Even from the shore large breaking waves can sweep you off your feet and out to sea. Take care if walking near cliffs; know your route and keep dogs on a lead. In an emergency, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard. \n\nBe prepared for weather warnings to change quickly. When a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.", "modifiedDate": "2025-09-11T09:35:16Z", "validFromDate": "2025-09-14T19:00:00Z", "affectedAreas": [ { "regionName": "London & South East England", "regionCode": "SE", "subRegions": [ "Brighton and Hove", "East Sussex", "Hampshire", "Isle of Wight", "Kent", "Portsmouth", "Southampton", "Surrey", "West Sussex" ] }, { "regionName": "North West England", "regionCode": "NW", "subRegions": [ "Blackpool", "Cheshire West and Chester", "Halton", "Lancashire", "Merseyside" ] }, { "regionName": "South West England", "regionCode": "SW", "subRegions": [ "Bath and North East Somerset", "Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole", "Bristol", "Cornwall", "Devon", "Dorset", "Gloucestershire", "Isles of Scilly", "North Somerset", "Plymouth", "Somerset", "South Gloucestershire", "Torbay", "Wiltshire" ] }, { "regionName": "Wales", "regionCode": "WL", "subRegions": [ "Blaenau Gwent", "Bridgend", "Caerphilly", "Cardiff", "Carmarthenshire", "Ceredigion", "Conwy", "Denbighshire", "Flintshire", "Gwynedd", "Isle of Anglesey", "Merthyr Tydfil", "Monmouthshire", "Neath Port Talbot", "Newport", "Pembrokeshire", "Powys", "Rhondda Cynon Taf", "Swansea", "Torfaen", "Vale of Glamorgan" ] } ], "warningImpact": 3, "validToDate": "2025-09-15T17:00:00Z" }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [ -4.3616, 53.5762 ], [ -4.6637, 53.6055 ], [ -4.8065, 53.5925 ], [ -4.8999, 53.5403 ], [ -4.9548, 53.2652 ], [ -5.0317, 52.836 ], [ -5.0647, 52.6097 ], [ -5.2295, 52.3957 ], [ -5.4932, 52.2009 ], [ -5.647, 52.0052 ], [ -5.5371, 51.6794 ], [ -5.3064, 51.5907 ], [ -5.1416, 51.5156 ], [ -5.0098, 51.3855 ], [ -4.9329, 51.2619 ], [ -4.8999, 51.1518 ], [ -4.9219, 51.0414 ], [ -5.0427, 50.8129 ], [ -5.1416, 50.6773 ], [ -5.3833, 50.475 ], [ -5.6085, 50.356 ], [ -6.0095, 50.2332 ], [ -6.405, 50.0959 ], [ -6.5863, 50.0148 ], [ -6.6577, 49.9265 ], [ -6.6467, 49.8486 ], [ -6.4435, 49.7919 ], [ -6.1743, 49.7706 ], [ -5.9106, 49.76 ], [ -5.5042, 49.8025 ], [ -5.2295, 49.8451 ], [ -4.9438, 49.8805 ], [ -4.6472, 50.043 ], [ -4.2297, 50.1065 ], [ -3.6804, 50.0783 ], [ -3.3289, 50.1558 ], [ -3.0103, 50.3735 ], [ -2.5708, 50.4015 ], [ -2.0325, 50.4295 ], [ -1.3293, 50.5064 ], [ -0.6262, 50.6355 ], [ -0.0989, 50.6808 ], [ 0.412, 50.7365 ], [ 0.8899, 50.8337 ], [ 1.3513, 50.9446 ], [ 1.4612, 51.0897 ], [ 1.571, 51.2413 ], [ 1.5491, 51.3786 ], [ 1.4777, 51.454 ], [ 1.1151, 51.4472 ], [ 0.9723, 51.4472 ], [ 0.8295, 51.3443 ], [ 0.1154, 51.2447 ], [ -0.3172, 51.246 ], [ -0.561, 51.2133 ], [ -1.0904, 51.2344 ], [ -1.4447, 51.2654 ], [ -1.7029, 51.4309 ], [ -1.9666, 51.5327 ], [ -2.1423, 51.693 ], [ -2.2961, 51.8358 ], [ -2.5104, 51.8494 ], [ -2.6704, 51.8133 ], [ -2.9004, 51.8358 ], [ -3.1915, 51.9443 ], [ -3.3398, 52.0187 ], [ -3.3968, 52.155 ], [ -3.4772, 52.4158 ], [ -3.5486, 52.6997 ], [ -3.5815, 52.9176 ], [ -3.6186, 53.1295 ], [ -3.5074, 53.1719 ], [ -3.4346, 53.1756 ], [ -3.3652, 53.1772 ], [ -3.2849, 53.1797 ], [ -3.1407, 53.1546 ], [ -2.9965, 53.1554 ], [ -2.8276, 53.1583 ], [ -2.7507, 53.2126 ], [ -2.6889, 53.2948 ], [ -2.7026, 53.3686 ], [ -2.7411, 53.5207 ], [ -2.774, 53.7552 ], [ -2.8894, 53.9302 ], [ -3.1119, 54.0191 ], [ -3.2602, 53.9803 ], [ -3.3344, 53.713 ], [ -3.3481, 53.457 ], [ -3.8452, 53.3686 ], [ -4.1528, 53.5077 ], [ -4.3616, 53.5762 ] ] ] ] } }
